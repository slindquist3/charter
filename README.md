# Charter Coding Challenge

- Thanks for taking the time to review my challenge!

## Highlights

- Completed the assignment
- Minimized amount of iterations needed and avoided nesting
- The logic for building the data structure could accommodate any number of months

## What I would improve

- In the DataTable component I am hardcoding text as well as how the points per month are accessed. With more time I'd find a more efficient and dynamic way to do this.
- I would destructure more of the props I pass to DataTable so that all the calculations could be performed at the top level and the props could be more transparently declared
- The table is responsive as is, but I would add more styling to beautify the page
